# EbayLegoWebscrape
## Lego webscraper for Ebay

Sold a set on Ebay for a **3X in 4 years.**  
Wondered what set characteristics make for a good investment - theme? size? figurines?  
Time - is there a sweet spot in terms of ROI vs time since set retirement?

Goals:
1. Scrape Ebay data for set prices 
   1. need set metadata 
      1. date released 
      2. date retired 
      3. theme/subtheme 
      4. MSRP 
      5. no of pieces 
         1. might need to learn APIs, this data is difficult to find
2. Store data in anything except a spreadsheet!
   1. spreadsheets **are not** for data storage
   2. I repeat, spreadsheets are not for data storage
   3. will need to learn some basic SQL
3. Analyze data (Power BI, jupyter?)
   1. Power BI should be easy, star schema?
   2. Jupyter would be fun to try out some basic data science
      1. I can already see some outlier detection would be handy on sale price data
