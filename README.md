# EbayLegoWebscrape
Lego webscraper for Ebay

Sold a set on Ebay for a 3X in 4 years.
Wondered what set characteristics make for a good investment - theme? size? figurines?.

Goals:
1) Scrape Ebay data for set prices (need set metadata...)
2) Store data in anything except a spreadsheet!
3) Analyze data (Power BI, jupyter?)
